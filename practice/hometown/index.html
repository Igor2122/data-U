        <p>Bahrain is the site of the ancient Dilmun civilisation.[10] It has been famed since antiquity for its pearl fisheries, which were considered the best in the world into the 19th century.[11] Bahrain was one of the earliest areas to convert to Islam, in 628 CE. Following a period of Arab rule, Bahrain was occupied by the Portuguese in 1521, who in turn were expelled in 1602 by Shah Abbas I of the Safavid dynasty under the Persian Empire.
